# SVG Generator 

An interactive tool for creating and customizing SVG pattern designs. This project allows users to generate various SVG patterns with customizable properties like shapes, sizes, colors, and gradients.

This is was a "Hello World" project for me to learn how to tackle a simple project which is actually something that would be a little beyond my normal coding skills to lean how to build with AI tools as a designer inspired by Meng (https://x.com/MengTo) and Local Ghost https://x.com/localghost. This started in Claude 3.5 Sonnet and then I used Cursor to expand the project.
